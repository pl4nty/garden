Hey, I'm Tom and this is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). I hope my notes, ideas, and experiments might help you ðŸ˜Š

At the moment, I'm writing about
* [Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/security/business/microsoft-intune) from my work at [Devicie](https://devicie.com/)
* Cloud-native tech from my [homelab](https://github.com/pl4nty/homelab) and contributions to [OTel](https://opentelemetry.io/) and [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)
* Linux and ARM hardware from my contributions to [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/)
