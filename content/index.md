Hey, I'm Tom and this is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). I hope my notes, ideas, and experiments might help you ðŸ˜Š

At the moment, I'm writing about

* [[Microsoft/Intune/index|Microsoft Intune]] and [[Microsoft/Windows/index|Windows]] from my work at [Devicie](https://devicie.com/)
* Cloud-native tech from my [[Homelab|homelab]] and contributions to [OTel](https://opentelemetry.io/) and [[Cloud/BuildKit|Cloud/BuildKit]]
* Linux and hardware (ARM/RISC-V SBCs) from my contributions to [[Talos|Talos Linux]]

I'm always happy to have a chat, so leave a comment or email me to get in touch. My email is in my git commits.
