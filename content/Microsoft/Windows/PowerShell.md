[Splatting with overload](https://beatcracker.wordpress.com/2014/12/01/splatting-and-mandatory-parameters/)

```PowerShell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url [tenant].sharepoint.com -Interactive -LaunchBrowser
```

```PowerShell
Import-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -UseWindowsPowerShell
```

```PowerShell
$data = Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri "dummy" -Method GET -OutputType HttpResponseMessage
$data.RequestMessage.Headers.Authorization.Parameter
```

## NuGet
`Install-Package` doesn't handle dependencies
`Add-Type -Path` can load DLLs though, if the method signatures are supported by PowerShell

[Import-Package](https://github.com/pwsh-cs-tools/Import-Package) is lesser-known and very useful

## SQLite

```powershell
Import-Package Microsoft.Data.Sqlite -Verbose
$client = New-Object Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.SqliteConnection -ArgumentList "Data Source=db.sqlite" # ::new() fails
$client.Open()

$cmd = $client.CreateCommand()
$cmd.CommandText = "CREATE TABLE test (foo TEXT)"
$cmd.ExecuteNonQuery()
$cmd.Dispose()

$cmd.CommandText = "INSERT INTO test (foo) VALUES ('bar')"
$cmd.ExecuteNonQuery()
$cmd.Dispose()

$cmd.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM test"
$reader = $cmd.ExecuteReader()
while ($reader.Read()) {
	Write-Host $reader.GetString(0)
}

# $client.Close() isn't enough to unlock the db
```

## Signing

At work we had a code signing cert expiring soon, so I wanted to start dual signing binaries/scripts and give users a chance to migrate their app control rules. But I couldn't find docs for PowerShell dual signing anywhere.
The tools I could find just overwrote the signature, rather than appending, so time to dig into the format. 

Signatures are PKCS#7 appended as base64 inside well-known comment formats. Windows uses [[Subject Interface Packages|Subject Interface Packages]] to parse the comments, via the `pwrshsip.dll` provider for both version 5 and 7. I found a [CryptSIPGetCaps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/mssip/nf-mssip-cryptsipgetcaps) function that returns [SIP_CAP_SET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/mssip/ns-mssip-sip_cap_set_v2) with an `isMultiSign` bool, but the PowerShell provider doesn't seem to implement it. Maybe I could register one and see what happens ([example](https://github.com/olivierh59500/PSBits/blob/81129bdc84c7760f4c9dc19f69362808ecf151cc/SIP/GTSIPProvider.c#L117))? But it's probably easier to just look at the code.

| File Extension          | Comment Format                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ps1<br>psd1<br>psm1     | `# SIG # Begin signature block`<br>`# <data>`<br>`# SIG # End signature block`                      |
| ps1xml<br>psc1<br>cdxml | `<!-- SIG # Begin signature block -->`<br>`<!-- <data> -->`<br>`<!-- SIG # End signature block -->` |
| mof                     | `/* SIG # Begin signature block */`<br>`/* <data> */`<br>`/* SIG # End signature block */`          |

Thanks to Ghidra (and some LLM tooling), the provider just reads the whole first comment block into `pbBinary` when getting a signature.

```c++
bool PsGetSignature(SIP_SUBJECTINFO *pSubjectInfo,DWORD *pdwIndex,DWORD dwIndex, DWORD *pcbSignedDataMsg,BYTE *pbSignedDataMsg)
                   
DWORD __thiscall SipProvider::GetSignature (SipProvider *this,SIP_SUBJECTINFO *pSubjectInfo,DWORD *pdwIndex,DWORD *pcbSignedDataMsg ,
          BYTE *pbSignedDataMsg)
          
ulong __thiscall PsScriptFile::ExtractSignature(PsScriptFile *this,Signature **ppSignature)

PsScriptSignature::LocateAndConvertFromString(PsScriptSignature *this,wchar_t *pScriptText,uint cchScriptLength,uint dwFileFormat)
<carving base64 into pSignatureBuffer>
CryptStringToBinaryW(pSignatureBuffer,dwSignatureStringLength,CRYPT_STRING_BASE64,pbBinary,&this->pbBinaryLength,(DWORD *)0x0,&dwCryptFlags);
```

The signature is PKCS#7 `SignedData` with no validation, so surely it could have multiple `SignerInfo` structs? I spent half an hour with `pyasn1` and didn't get the struct quite right in the end... But while trying to verify it, I found [PowerShell-OpenAuthenticode](https://github.com/jborean93/PowerShell-OpenAuthenticode) by the always-incredible Jordan Borean. Its`Add-OpenAuthenticodeSignature` would've saved me half an hour of scripting, and actually worked too.

Unfortunately AppLocker doesn't care - on my 19045.6332 test device (not EOL yet!) rules only evaluated against the first embedded signature. Event logs and `Get-AppLockerFileInformation` only showed the first subject too.

Stay tuned for testing with Airlock, WDAC, and maybe catalogue signatures. On a proper Win11 device ðŸ˜‰
