A collection of runtime process-level mitigation features, formerly known as Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET). Configurable via [RtlSetImageMitigationPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/rtlsetimagemitigationpolicy-function). Pretty much the user-configurable subset of [SetProcessMitigationPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-setprocessmitigationpolicy).
## Export
Forget what I wrote this for, might've been testing which mitigations worked system-wide
```PowerShell
Get-ProcessMitigation -System | select -ExcludeProperty ProcessName, Source, Id |  % {'<SystemConfig>'} {
  $_.psobject.properties | % {"  <$($_.name) $(
    $_.value.psobject.properties | % { $_.name+'="'+$_.value+'"' }
  ) />"}
} {'</SystemConfig>'}
```
## Schema
I wanted a schema for some codegen but couldn't find one, so I got to carving. `Microsoft.ProcessMitigations.Commands.dll` implements the PowerShell cmdlets so it seemed like a good place to start. ILSpy made quick work of them, they're just calling the win32 [MitigationConfiguration.dll](https://strontic.github.io/xcyclopedia/library/MitigationConfiguration.dll-159290A4FDB80AF51017DAAFA4FE58F8.html) (like `ValidateXMLFromManaged(path)`). 

It's pretty easy to call from PowerShell, but I don't really want to rely on Windows.

```powershell
Add-Type -TypeDefinition @"
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class MitigationConfig
{
    [DllImport("MitigationConfiguration.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Auto)]
    public static extern int ValidateXMLFromManaged(string fileName, ref bool result);
}
"@

$result = $false
$hr = [MitigationConfig]::ValidateXMLFromManaged("ExploitGuard.xml", [ref]$result)
Write-Host "Return code: $hr, Result: $result"
```

`ValidateXMLFromManaged` makes me think the DLL might have a schema somewhere. Strings didn't find anything,`Get-Content -Encoding unicode` was better - the XML properties were present, but as UTF-16 space-separated strings? With no types or anything. Time to pull out Ghidra.

It's COM... The decomp is gross, but it's pretty much just calling [IXMLDOMDocument2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ms761358(v=vs.85)).loadXML with XML validation enabled. No schema validation in sight, despite the [cmdlet arg mentioning an xsd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/processmitigations/set-processmitigation?view=windowsserver2025-ps#-isvalid), so I guess I'll build a schema myself.

```cpp
IXMLDOMDocument2 *xmlDoc = NULL;
hr = CoCreateInstance(&CLSID_DOMDocument60, NULL, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, &IID_IXMLDOMDocument2, (void**)&xmlDoc);
hr = xmlDoc->put_async(VARIANT_TRUE);
hr = xmlDoc->put_validateOnParse(VARIANT_TRUE);
hr = xmlDoc->put_resolveExternals(VARIANT_TRUE);
...
hr = xmlDoc->load(xmlVariant.bstrVal, &parseResult);
```

Those strings I was seeing were only used in `ImportMitigation`, not validation.

[Florian's great policy](https://github.com/Harvester57/Exploit-Protection-policy) was really helpful for testing, but his system config didn't match the supported types in the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/customize-exploit-protection#exploit-protection-mitigations) so I left an [issue](https://github.com/Harvester57/Exploit-Protection-policy/issues/11). Turns out the docs are just wrong.
My tooling (and skill lol) isn't good enough for a clean decomp of the C++ objects in `ImportMitigation`, but I suspect it's just passing parsed data straight to [RtlSetImageMitigationPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/rtlsetimagemitigationpolicy-function). Hard to tell without making a Ghidra type for [IXmlReader](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ms752743\(v=vs.85\)).
