The Windows debugger. Noone knows for sure how to pronounce it, but everyone has opinions. I'd love to know the etymology of these ones I've heard:
* windog - Christian? from Crowdstrike at BSides Canberra, might've been '23 or '24. Need to check cause I might've mishead
* windbag - James Spicer from Trenchant at Kawaiicon '25. Same as [Raymond Chen](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200128-00/?p=103371)
* windebug - the most common? wonder if there's a split between win debug and windy bug
* win d b g - maybe from incorrectly written WinDBG?
