As usual, I've co-opted a tech term to describe a metacognitive concept that probably has a much fancier name. I find it easy to get lost in routine. It's easy, somewhat rewarding, and comes naturally.
But inspired by [sean goedecke's post](https://www.seangoedecke.com/thinking-clearly/), there's greater value in breaking free (where viable). I'm glad the deliberate emptiness of my Sunday morning has inspired such an interrupt. A few quotes that stood out to me

>There are few higher-leverage things you can do in an organization than writing down clear thoughts about your work.

Having spent my career in startups, I'm only just starting to experience this. But I'm eager to see more.

>Focus on the invariants

I've found much success from this goal, like the author suggests. I wonder if it generalises beyond tech.

>work with people who are happy to sit in uncertainty for a while

Ain't that the truth. Uncertainty is universal in my eyes, so pretending it doesn't exist (or worse, believing so) is a fundamental conflict.
