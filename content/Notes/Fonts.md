I was making some PCB business cards based on [wh201906/RFIDetector](https://github.com/wh201906/RFIDetector/), and realised I don't really have a nice font for designs like this.
Figured I'd pick something open-source and I found a couple great sources
* https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/
* https://open-foundry.com/

Ended up going with [Bagnard Sans Regular](https://open-foundry.com/fonts/bagnard_sans_regular), a sans cut of Bagnard, which itself was inspired by the graffitis of an anonymous prisoner of the Napoleonic wars.
I like the sharp, almost brutalist angles, without the formality that I see in the serif cut. It's not exactly readable in print though, so I'll just use it for titles.

[Elias](https://jthv.ai/) uses [Libertinus](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus) which is much more readable, and the serif variant feels kinda elegant. But I don't want to just steal it. Leave a comment if you know some text fonts I should try.

For monospace, I've been a basic [tonsky/FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) user for like a decade. [Commit Mono](https://commitmono.com/) and [Monaspace](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace) are cool though. Maybe I'll commit to trying them for a month or so eventually.
