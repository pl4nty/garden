## PC
[PCPartPicker](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/user/pl4nty/saved/Mv284D). A pretty cursed full-tower from highschool, complete with obnoxious case and Haswell CPU.
It still performs ok, even if the lack of TPM makes Windows 11 a bit annoying. The graphics card is the main bottleneck - its HDMI/DP bandwidth limits my monitor to 75Hz, instead of its full 160Hz.
### PC Upgrade
Goals
* 5120x1440 @ 165Hz, slightly under 4K pixel count
* CPU-bound productivity, gaming

AM5 socket released 2022, supported to at least 2027. Adds DDR5 support
* CPU: Zen 5 with X3D cache? 9000X3D expected in September. May also have USB4
* Memory: 64GB or 96GB, bandwidth? RGB not needed. 128 would require careful mobo selection
* Graphics card: GTX 5000 series expected by Q1 25, wait and pick up a discounted 3080/4080? Need DP 1.4a or HDMI 2.1, so GTX 1080 minimum
* Mobo: Mini ITX for Terra case. B650E for PCIe 5.0
* Power supply: won't fit in case :( Nearing end of 10yr warranty anyway
* Storage: Crucial T500, same as homelab? or use the 5.0 T700s for way more $. Could reuse old WD Black 2TB too

## Monitor
[HP E45c G5 44.5 inch DQHD Curved Monitor](https://www.hp.com/au-en/shop/hp-e45c-g5-dqhd-curved-monitor-6n4c1aa.html). Dual USB-C is perfect for laptops, and I got it for like $800 on FB Marketplace from a bankrupt startup.
## Mouse
Started with a Corsair M65 RGB and QCK+ mousepad, then swapped to custom mousepads from the mechanical [[Keyboards|Keyboards]] community.
Eventually bought a [Pwnage Ultra Custom](https://pwnage.com/products/ultra-custom-wireless-ergo) and modded it with a larger battery. Used that for ages until cheaper Finalmouse-style mice started appearing, like WLmouse.
I bought a [WLmouse Beast X Max](https://www.wlmouse.com/en-wl/products/beast-max) and currently use it with a few different green-themed mousemats, including [GMK Botanical](https://oblotzky.industries/products/gmk-cyl-botanical-2)

## Debugging
Currently using a cheap [sipeed/RV-Debugger-BL702](https://github.com/sipeed/RV-Debugger-BL702) for UART, but I'm looking forward to my [Glasgow Interface Explorer](https://glasgow-embedded.org/latest/intro.html) arriving soon.
Even if it's overkill, I'm glad to support open hardware and especially [Catherine](https://github.com/whitequark)'s work.
