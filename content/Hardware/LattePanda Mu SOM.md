x86 System On Module with a custom 260-pin SODIMM pinout and plenty of I/O. 2x Intel N100 SKUs, 1x N305 SKU. N305 is new in Jan 2025 and unreviewed, plus fairly expensive vs traditional socketed CPUs.

They also have Lite and Full carrier board options with [open source schematics and pinout](https://github.com/LattePandaTeam/LattePanda-Mu). May not match production though, PCB has a typo in the silkscreen branding.

For firmware, they use UEFI with mainline Linux support
Proprietary firmware

## Turing Pi 2 compatibility
I have a Turing Pi 2 cluster board with 260-pin SODIMM slots. Turing Machines built a [Raspberry Pi CM4 adapter](https://turingpi.com/product/cm4-adapter/), could I build one for the Mu?
I got hold of this datasheet for their RK1 SOM, including a compatible pinout which we could map to the Mu.

![[Turing RK1 Data Sheet V1.0-20231103.pdf|Turing RK1 Data Sheet V1.0-20231103.pdf]]

The Mu is pretty different, let's start by mapping the essentials. The Lite carrier board schematic should help. Looks like we'll need
* SuperIO ([Super I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_I/O)) for power and debug UART
* HSIO2 for M.2 M-key (PCIe x4) ie NVMe storage
* HSIO6 for GbE (gigabit ethernet)

Those high-speed I/O (HSIO) pins are using [differential signalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_signalling) so we'll need to consider EMF noise, and that's far beyond my PCB design skills.
I was quoted 700USD and around a month on Fiverr. That's well above my budget and I've only seen a few people interested in this idea, so I probably can't recover costs. Can't go any further unfortunately.
