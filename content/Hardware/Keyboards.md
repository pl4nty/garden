## Womier K66
Dark stacked acrylic
Closed-source firmware, might've been a QMK fork but RGB support was iffy
Fn+Space then press key to pick colour
Fn + left/right Ctrl to cycle patterns

## [splitkb Elora rev 1.0](https://splitkb.com/collections/keyboard-kits/products/elora)
My first preassembled board. The split community has come a long way since I built the Sofle in 2021, the Elora docs were excellent and I had it assembled and working in under an hour.
The Myriad modules idea is pretty cool, but I really only use the encoder. It's too far from the thumb clusters.
#TODO port to zmk when full wired support is available
## Sofle v1
Haven't used in ages cause I like the Elora thumb clusters too much. But this was my first build, and I really enjoyed the hours of soldering and assembly.
## Aluminium keycaps
Gateron did a beautiful gray/gold set for 400 euros: https://keygem.com/en-au/products/gateron-aluminium-keycaps-pre-order?variant=43568303767820
May not have enough mods for a large split though. I've been thinking of building a Corne but these caps would be wasted on a display board.
