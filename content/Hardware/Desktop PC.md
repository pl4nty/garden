* CPU-bound productivity, gaming, some CUDA AI

AM5 socket released 2022, supported to at least 2027. Adds DDR5 support
CPU - Zen 5 with X3D cache? 9000X3D expected in September. May also have USB4
Memory - 64GB, bandwidth? RGB not needed
Graphics card - GTX 5000 series expected by Q1 25, wait and pick up a discounted 3080/4080? 
Mobo - Mini ITX for Terra case. B650E for PCIe 5.0
Crucial T500 storage, same as homelab? or use the 5.0 T700s for way more $. could reuse old WD Black HDD
