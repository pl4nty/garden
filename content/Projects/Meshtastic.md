## Heltec v3 setup
The case comes closed, but it's easiest to open from the tail with a shim or screwdriver.
The supplied antenna isn't great so I installed a RAK one. If I had a drill, I reckon it could be mounted in the tail, but for now I'm routing the connector through the hole under the USB-C port. Don't want to get in the way of headers too much.

Flashing needs a driver. I used the Universal Windows Driver from [CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers - Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads), and installed it manually via Device Manager. Find the faulty device under "Other devices" > right click > Update driver > Browse computer > Open the extracted zip. Then go to https://flasher.meshtastic.org/.
